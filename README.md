## Future Development

Right now when a user adds a role they are provided with the department ids. I would like to get it so the user is prompted with the department names so it is easier to navigate.
Right now when a user adds an employee they are provided with the role id and manager id. I would like to get it so the user is prompted with the role name and the managers full name.
